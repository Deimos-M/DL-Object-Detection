# Object Detection using YoloV3
* Object detection is a task in computer vision that involves identifying the presence, location, and type of one or more objects in a given photograph and bounding them in the boxes preferably of different colours. This repository consists of code that is used to implement object detection using the yolov3 algorithm. The code is written in Keras and python3.To reduce hecticness and time consumption of training a model from scratch I have used the pre-trained weights and loaded it into the exact same model architecture.
